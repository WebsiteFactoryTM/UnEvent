  **UnEvent** is a scalable event discovery and listing platform built with Next.js (frontend) and PayloadCMS v3 (backend).
  It connects people with event locations, service providers, and organizers through searchable listings.

  The architecture follows a **monorepo** structure using pnpm workspaces, Docker-based Postgres + Redis services, and clean separation between frontend and backend.

  MVP goals:
  - Allow free listing of Locations, Services, and Events
  - Filter by city, date, and category
  - Organizer profiles with reviews, messaging, and rating
  - SEO-friendly pages and dynamic revalidation via Payload â†” Next.js integration

rules:
  - Use modern, modular architecture with clearly separated concerns.
  - Prioritize maintainability and clarity over brevity.
  - Ensure all code is type-safe, with clear naming and reusable components.
  - Always follow the conventions defined in general, backend, and frontend rulesets.
  - Include rules/general.mdc
  - Include rules/backend.mdc
  - Include rules/frontend.mdc
